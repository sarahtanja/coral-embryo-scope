# coral-embryo-scope

A repo for the microscopy imaging annotations and survival analysis of *Montipora capitata* embryos exposed to increasing levels of PVC leachate pollution.

This repository contains code and output for a **survival** analysis of coral embryos exposed to 3 increasing levels of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) leachate. *Montipora capitata* rice coral embryos were subjected to a single-stressor ecotoxicology assay designed to test the impact of PVC leachate on their early development. You can check out the complimentary repositories for a **gene expression** [coral-embryo-RNAseq](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-embryo-RNAseq) and **microbiome** (coral-embryo-microbiome) [coral-embryo-microbiome](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-embryo-microbiome) analysis from the same ecotoxicological assay.
