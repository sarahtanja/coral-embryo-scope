# Background
Each sample (aka each microscopy slide) resulted in a total embryo count.
 
For each sample, each embryo counted was classified by:
- stage
- status

## Input
- each sample's own annotation .csv found in `data/scope_annotation_data`
## Output
- `data/output/tidy_bros` each row is an embryo
- `data/output/tidy_vials` each row is a sample

# Install & load packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

# tidy_bros : each row is an embryo
There should be 120 csv files, representing each sample, named by the convention of: 
- 10 'crosses' of somewhat random parentage **(1-10)**
- 4 'treatments' encompassing a control, low, mid, and high pvc leachate exposure **(C, L, M, H)**
- 3 'embryonic stages' or hours post-fertilization **(4, 9, 14)**

The columns for each file are:
- sample_name = col_character()
- embryo_no = col_integer()
- embryo_phase = col_factor()
- status = col_factor
- notes = col_factor
::: callout-note
`list.files()` finds all .csv files in the directory.
`map_dfr(read_csv)` reads each file and binds rows together (\_dfr = data frame row-bind).
:::
```{r}
# list all csv files
csv <- list.files("../data/scope_annotation_data", pattern = "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)

# Combine all csv's into one tidy df and keep sheet name as row name
tidy_embryos <- csv %>% 
    map_dfr(~ read_csv(.x, col_types = 
                         cols(sample_name = col_character()))) 

# Change sample_name column to sample_id to match metadata column name  
tidy_embryos <- tidy_embryos %>% 
  mutate(sample_id = sample_name,
         stage = embryo_phase) %>%
  select(sample_id, stage, status) 
  

summary(tidy_embryos)
unique(tidy_embryos$stage)
unique(tidy_embryos$status)
```


## Add metadata

```{r}
metadata <- read_csv("../data/metadata/scope-metadata.csv")
```

```{r}
metadata_clean <- metadata %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%d/%m/%Y")) %>%
  select(
    sample_id,
    parent_1 = parent_colony_a,
    parent_2 = parent_colony_b,
    treatment = leachate,
    hpf,
    date
  )

tidy_embryos <- tidy_embryos %>%
  left_join(metadata_clean, by = "sample_id")

str(tidy_embryos)
```

## Collapse to morula

```{r}
tidy_bros <- tidy_embryos %>% 
  mutate(stage = if_else(stage %in% c("4to16cell", "32to64cell"), "morula", stage))

unique(tidy_bros$stage)
```

## Order factors

```{r}
# Set your levels in order
# embryo_phase
bro_levels <- c("egg", "cleavage", "morula", "prawnchip", "earlygastrula")

# treatment
treat_levels <- c("control", "low", "mid", "high")

# status
status_levels <- c("typical", "uncertain", "malformed")


# Mutate dataframe to set factor levels
tidy_bros <- tidy_bros %>%
  mutate(stage = factor(stage, 
                        levels = bro_levels,
                        ordered = TRUE),
         treatment = factor(treatment, 
                            levels = treat_levels,
                            ordered = TRUE),
         status = factor(status, 
                         levels = status_levels,
                         ordered = TRUE))

str(tidy_bros)
```

What colony crosses were used in spawning for microscopy?

```{r}
tidy_bros %>% distinct(parent_1, parent_2)
```

## QAQC zeros & NAs

Which samples had ZERO embryos to count?

```{r}
tidy_bros %>% 
  filter(if_any(everything(), is.na))
```

::: callout-warning
Here we have 9 samples that will need some attention... they did not contain any (0) viable embryos... only disintegrating embryos or embryo debris. How do we handle these zeros? How do we count a 'zero'? Of note cross 2 (from the rack corals; 30-Orange (O) and 1-White (W) ) had no fertilization and it should be removed entirely from the analysis. Note that at 4 hpf cross 2 eggs had not yet dissolved despite having zero fertilization! This is good evidence that the unfertilized eggs are still visible at 4 hpf.
:::

## Drop cross 2
Filter out (that is exclude) cross 2

```{r}
tidy_bros <- tidy_bros %>% 
  filter(!grepl("2", sample_id))
```

There should now be no `NAs` in `status` except for samples 3L9 & 7H9.. which had zero viable embryos! **...But what do we do with that?**
```{r}
tidy_bros %>% 
  filter(if_any(everything(), is.na))
```
![Sample 3L9 only contained two dissolving debris fragments](../images/3L9/3L9_4xstitch_anno.jpg)
![Sample 7H9 contained many dissolving debris fragments, but none appearing viable](../images/7H9/7H9_manualstitch_anno.jpg)

## Problems with eggs

- At 4 hpf eggs are still intact and visible even if unfertilized (e.g. cross 2), however they MAY BE FERTILIZED and developing normally but just not yet cleaved. So we cannot assume that all eggs at 4 hpf are unfertilized.

- At 9 and 14 hpf unfertilized eggs may have dissolved and no longer be visible.

- So are eggs visible at 9 or 14 hpf fertilized but developmentally delayed? OR are they unfertilized and just lingering for an unknown reason?

- Can you visually tell if an egg is fertilized prior to cellular division?

- Unfertilized eggs typically show no signs of cellular division. If they turn 'fuzzy', they are not viable and may be decomposing.

## Save dataframe

```{r}
write_csv(tidy_bros, "../data/output/tidy_bros.csv")
```

# tidy_vials : each row is a sample

Counts and proportions of combined and distinct stage and status values in each vial
```{r}
# Count + proportion per group
vials <- tidy_bros %>%
  count(sample_id, stage, status, name = "n") %>%
  group_by(sample_id) %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = c(stage, status),
    values_from = c(n, prop),
    values_fill = 0
  ) %>% 
  select(!matches("NA"))%>%
  left_join(metadata_clean, by = "sample_id")

str(vials)

```

```{r}
tidy_vials <- tidy_bros %>%
  group_by(sample_id) %>%
  summarise(
    n_embryos = n(),
    n_typical = sum(status == "typical"),
    n_malformed = sum(status == "malformed"),
    n_uncertain = sum(status == "uncertain"),
    prop_typical = mean(status == "typical"),
    prop_malformed = mean(status == "malformed"),
    prop_uncertain = mean(status == "uncertain"),
    n_egg = sum(stage == "egg"),
    prop_egg = mean(stage == "egg"),
    n_cleavage = sum(stage == "cleavage"),
    prop_cleavage = mean(stage == "cleavage"),
    n_morula = sum(stage == "morula"),
    prop_morula = mean(stage == "morula"),
    n_prawnchip = sum(stage == "prawnchip"),
    prop_prawnchip = mean(stage == "prawnchip"),
    n_earlygastrula = sum(stage == "earlygastrula"),
    prop_earlygastrula = mean(stage == "earlygastrula"),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

str(tidy_vials)
```

```{r}
tidy_vials <- tidy_vials %>% 
  left_join(vials, by = "sample_id") %>% 
  relocate(c(treatment, hpf, parent_1, parent_2, date), .after = sample_id)
```
## make a column for viable embryo counts

This means malformed = dead, uncertain(torn) = viable. 
Ecologically, a malformed embryo isn't progressing.. but a torn embryo could continue to develop!

So we're only counting the total number of embryos that are typical or uncertain. To do that let's make new columns called n_viable and prop_viable for the number of viable embryos and proportion of viable embryos.

::: callout-important
We say that eggs at 4 hpf are viable unless they are malformed.

At 9 and 14 hpf we say that all eggs are non-viable (i.e. unfertilized) so we subtract those from the viable count as well.
:::

```{r}
tidy_vials <- tidy_vials %>%
  mutate(
    n_viable = case_when(
      hpf == 4 ~ n_embryos - (n_egg_malformed + 
                              n_cleavage_malformed + 
                              n_morula_malformed +
                              n_prawnchip_malformed +
                              n_earlygastrula_malformed),
      hpf %in% c(9, 14) ~ n_embryos - (n_egg + 
                                        n_egg_malformed + 
                                        n_cleavage_malformed + 
                                        n_morula_malformed +
                                        n_prawnchip_malformed +
                                        n_earlygastrula_malformed)
    )
  ) %>%
  relocate(n_viable, .before = n_embryos) %>%
  mutate(prop_viable = n_viable / n_embryos) %>%
  relocate(prop_viable, .before = n_embryos)
```

## QAQC zeros & NAs
```{r}
tidy_vials %>% 
  filter(if_any(everything(), is.na))
```

3L9 had zero embryos & 7H9 had zero embryos
These samples show '1' embryo, but the row was just a placeholder and really there were no viable embryos found in these sample (see above). Here we simply replace the '1' with a '0' and all the NA values in the columns with '0'. 

```{r}
tidy_vials <- tidy_vials %>%
  mutate(across(
    c(n_viable, prop_viable, n_embryos),
    ~if_else(sample_id %in% c("3L9", "7H9"), 0, .)
  ))
```

Should no longer be NA... n_viable and prop_viable and n_embryos should be 0
```{r}
tidy_vials %>% 
  filter(sample_id == c("3L9", "7H9"))
```

## Order factors
Sometimes for plotting purposes we need hpf to be ordered as a factor and not a numerical data
```{r}
tidy_vials <- tidy_vials %>% 
  mutate(hpf = factor(hpf, levels = c("4","9","14"), ordered = TRUE ),
         treatment = factor(treatment, levels = c("control", "low", "mid", "high"), ordered = TRUE),
         )
```

## Save dataframe
```{r}
write_csv(tidy_vials, "../data/output/tidy_vials.csv")
```

# Summary & Next Steps

Ok! We have two tidy dataframes in long format to work with that should allow us to answer all our questions.


The following are thought-experiment dataframes... not fully flushed out yet

## embryos_summary : 
```{r}
# Count embryos per (sample_id, stage, status)
embryos_summary <- tidy_bros %>%
  count(sample_id, stage, status, name = "n_embryos") %>%
  group_by(sample_id) %>%
  mutate(proportion = n_embryos / sum(n_embryos)) %>%
  ungroup()

```

## stage_totals :
```{r}
# Total counts per stage per sample_id
stage_totals <- tidy_bros %>%
  count(sample_id, stage, name = "total_n")
```
