Additionally, we will use a beta regression model (using the betareg R package, (Cribari-Neto and Zeileis 2010) to analyze differences in the proportion of embryos reaching expected developmental stages across treatments(Cribari-Neto and Zeileis 2010). Differences in embryonic development among treatments will be evaluated using the joint_tests function from the emmeans R package (E. E. Chille et al. 2022; Searle, Speed, and Milliken 1980), which will run a beta regression model as a type III ANOVA (E. E. Chille et al. 2022; Searle, Speed, and Milliken 1980).
